        <h2 class="lstw-f-heading-1">Overview of Python in HR Shared Services</h2>
        <p class="lstw-f-body-1">
          Python has become a versatile tool in HR shared services for automating and enhancing various administrative processes. HR functions like <strong>timecards, payroll, accounts receivable, and invoicing</strong> involve large volumes of data and repetitive tasks, which Python can streamline. For example, Python scripts can pull and <strong>verify timecard entries</strong> from different systems, flagging any discrepancies for review 
          (<a href="https://flobotics.io/blog/payroll-process-rpa/#:~:text=Time%20tracking%20%E2%80%94%20Payroll%20software,if%20it%20finds%20any%20discrepancies" target="_blank">Automating Payroll Processes With RPA: What Can Be Done?</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="lstw-f-body-1">
          In payroll, HR teams leverage Python to <strong>manage payroll data</strong>, generate reports, and analyze workforce trends automatically 
          (<a href="https://www.pythoncentral.io/can-you-use-python-to-automate-hr-reporting-heres-what-to-know/#:~:text=Python%27s%20popularity%20in%20the%20tech,trends%2C%20and%20managing%20payroll%20data" target="_blank">Can You Use Python to Automate HR Reporting? Here's What to Know</a>). Similarly, in accounts receivable and invoicing, Python can consolidate data from spreadsheets or databases and perform checks – ensuring invoice amounts and payments match, and highlighting any irregularities.
        </p>
        <p class="lstw-f-body-1">
          By automating these routine HR tasks, Python reduces manual effort and errors, allowing HR shared services teams to operate more efficiently and consistently.

      <section id="discrepancy-detection">
        <h2 class="lstw-f-heading-1">Use Cases for Financial Discrepancy Detection</h2>
        <p class="lstw-f-body-1">
          One of the high-impact applications of Python in HR shared services is detecting financial discrepancies and anomalies in transactions. By processing datasets of payroll records, invoices, or payments, Python can identify outliers or mismatches that warrant attention. Common discrepancy use cases include:
        </p>
        <ul class="lstw-f-body-1">
          <li><strong>Overpayments:</strong> Python can cross-verify payouts against expected values to catch instances where an employee or vendor was paid more than intended. Scripts can recalculate wages from timecard inputs to ensure no one is paid for more hours than logged (<a href="https://splashbi.com/anomaly-detection-elevate-people-analytics/#:~:text=Anomaly%20detection%20at%20the%20gross,are%20paid%20timely%20%26%20correctly" target="_blank">Leverage Anomaly Detection to Elevate People Analytics Insights</a>).</li>
          <li><strong>Underpayments:</strong> Python can detect if someone was underpaid by validating payroll calculations and comparing them to the actual paid amount (<a href="https://splashbi.com/anomaly-detection-elevate-people-analytics/#:~:text=Anomaly%20detection%20at%20the%20gross,are%20paid%20timely%20%26%20correctly" target="_blank">Leverage Anomaly Detection to Elevate People Analytics Insights</a>).</li>
          <li><strong>Duplicate Transactions:</strong> Python can scan transaction data for duplicates by checking key fields like invoice numbers, dates, vendor names, or amounts (<a href="https://www.auditwithpython.com/data-analytics-blog/5-tips-for-finding-duplicate-payments#:~:text=The%20main%20columns%20you%E2%80%99re%20going,see%20if%20they%20repeat%20are" target="_blank">5 Tips for Finding Duplicate Payments</a>).</li>
          <li><strong>Unusual Patterns or Outliers:</strong> Python’s data libraries enable statistical checks to identify atypical expense claims or irregular payroll spikes (<a href="https://splashbi.com/anomaly-detection-elevate-people-analytics/#:~:text=By%20definition%2C%20anomaly%20detection%20identifies,outlier%20detection%20is%20used%20interchangeably" target="_blank">Leverage Anomaly Detection to Elevate People Analytics Insights</a>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lstw-f-body-1">
          In all these cases, Python acts as a <strong>watchdog</strong> over financial transactions – quickly scanning through timecard logs, payroll registers, or accounting ledgers to spot red flags. This automated approach ensures discrepancies are caught proactively.

      <section id="integration">
        <h2 class="lstw-f-heading-1">Integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Fabric</h2>
        <p class="lstw-f-body-1">
          Integrating Python with enterprise HR and finance systems is key to making the most of automation. Many organizations use <strong>Microsoft Dynamics 365</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Fabric</strong> to manage data and analytics. Python can seamlessly connect with these platforms:
        </p>
        <ul class="lstw-f-body-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Dynamics 365:</strong> Python can interact with Dynamics 365 data through APIs or data connectors. By querying the Dynamics 365 REST API, developers can extract payroll transactions and invoices for analysis 
            (<a href="https://muabusalah.medium.com/how-to-access-microsoft-dynamics-365-rest-api-using-python-841198159140#:~:text=How%20to%20Access%20Microsoft%20Dynamics,5" target="_blank">How to Access Microsoft Dynamics 365 REST API using Python</a>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Microsoft Fabric:</strong> Fabric provides a unified analytics platform that supports Python natively. Python notebooks in Fabric can directly access data from the Lakehouse or Warehouse, allowing for real-time analysis 
            (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/using-python-experience-on-notebook#:~:text=,manipulation%2C%20analysis%2C%20and%20machine%20learning" target="_blank">Using Python in Microsoft Fabric Notebooks</a>).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lstw-f-body-1">
          By integrating with systems like Dynamics 365 and Fabric, Python becomes the analytical glue that connects data extraction, processing, and analysis across the enterprise.
